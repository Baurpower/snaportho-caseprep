"ANATOMY               Average adult femoral neck shaft angle is 135, but this is only an average. The neck angle can be measured by placing one line down the center of the femoral shaft and a second line down the center of the femoral neck.   A high neck angle is a Valgus Hip,  a low neck angle is a Varus hip.  The amount of varus or valgus can also be measured by placing a point at the center of the femoral head (representing the hip center) and extending a line out to the tip of the greater trochanter (see picture).  In a ""normal hip"" the center of the femoral head should be at the same level as the tip of the greater trochanter, while a Varus Hip the center of the femoral head lies below the tip of the greater troch, and a Valgus Hip the center of the femoral head lies above the tip of the greater troch.    Importantly the neck angle affects forces across the hip because it changes the tension of the abductor mechanism.  A valgus hip results in improved mechanical advantage to the abductor while a varus hip generates greater forces across the hip center.     Most femoral components of a total hip replacement rely on bony ingrowth for long term fixation.  Bony ingrowth occurs during the first 6 weeks after a THA, and similar to the fracture healing, it requires micromotion < 50 nm for ingrowth to occur, otherwise, fibrous ingrowth occurs and there is increased risk for persistent motion, early loosening and symptoms of thigh pain.  Thus, for proper ingrowth to occur, the press-fit must be obtained at the time of surgery - the implant must fill the proximal canal and place enough hoop stress on the rim of cortical bone to prevent micromotion.  Both axial (the stem doesnt sink into the femoral canal) and torsional (the stem cannot rotate within the canal) stability are required for initial stem fixation.    The best press-fit occurs when the implant design matches the native femoral canal.  The challenge is the variability of proximal femur anatomy within the population.  The Dorr Classification is the most commonly used classification system for describing the relationship between the proximal femoral anatomy and the emoral diaphysis, otherwise known as the Canal-Flare Index.  This can help with surgical planning to select a stem that will maximize the ability of achieving a press-fit during surgery. In general, as we get older, we lose bone stock, and the metaphyseal region of the proximal femoral canal becomes more and more capacious.  This has implications on the ability to use a non-cemented/press-fit stem.     More specifically the Dorr Classification describes the relationship of the diameter of the proximal femoral canal relative to the femoral diaphysis.  Its calculated by measuring the ratio between the canal width at lesser trochanter and the canal width 10 cm below the lesser troch.  It actually measures the relative thickness of the cortex by calculating the difference between the full diameter of the bone compared to the diameter of the canal alone (see diagram).         TYPE A femurs have a thick cortex and narrow canal (referred to as a “champagne flute”) and commonly found in men and younger patients.  It permits good cementless fixation with low risk of fracture, however, selecting the proper implant can be challenging given the metaphyseal-diaphyseal mismatch.  A single wedge stem design is often used.     TYPE B femurs demonstrate some medial and posterior cortex bone loss, and therefore a wider canal, and are an intermediary between Type A and C.  Most femurs are a Type B.   TYPE C femurs demonstrate significant cortical bone loss particularly in the medial and posterior cortex with a capacious canal (referred to as a “stovepipe”), and is common in postmenopausal women and should warn surgeons of concern for cementless fixation particularly difficulty in controlling rotational motion, and increased risk for intraoperative fracture."

Importantly the neck angle affects forces across the hip because it changes the tension of the abductor mechanism.  A valgus hip results in improved mechanical advantage to the abductor while a varus hip generates greater forces across the hip center.     Most femoral components of a total hip replacement rely on bony ingrowth for long term fixation.  Bony ingrowth occurs during the first 6 weeks after a THA, and similar to the fracture healing, it requires micromotion < 50 nm for ingrowth to occur, otherwise, fibrous ingrowth occurs and there is increased risk for persistent motion, early loosening and symptoms of thigh pain.  Thus, for proper ingrowth to occur, the press-fit must be obtained at the time of surgery - the implant must fill the proximal canal and place enough hoop stress on the rim of cortical bone to prevent micromotion.

Rollback is essential to achieve full deep flexion (which is seen with squatting or deep bends).  Without rollback, the back of the femoral diaphysis will impinge on the tibia around 90°, however, if the distal femur moves posteriorly in relation to the tibia, it increases the clearance before impingment, and thus allows for extra flexion. Ultimately, impingement does occur (between the lateral tibia and the posterior cortex of the distal femur) and this marks terminal flexion.

The goal of acetabular cup placement is to match the implant's range of motion to:   {{c1::the native hip's range of motion}}											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Hip::BasicConcepts::CupPlacement"
{{c1::Impingement}} in THA occurs when our anatomy wants to move the hip beyond what is permitted by the orientation of the implant	For example, the architecture of our body is designed to allow the femur to adduct about 30 degrees, however, if the cup is not properly anteverted, neck of the implant will impinge on the cup at only 20 degrees										"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Hip::BasicConcepts::CupPlacement"

A {{c1::lateralized::medialized/lateralized}} hip center depth shortens the “abductor lever arm” and thus requires the abductors to work harder to counteract the body weight force acting on the hip											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Hip::BasicConcepts::CupPlacement"
Inferior border of acetabular cup should be at the “{{c1::tear drop}}”, assessed by AP of hip	Clinical Correlate: A high hip center (which is sometimes done intentionally in cases of DDH when there is poor native bone stock around the native acetabulum) affects the abductor muscle tension and increases the joint reactive forces										"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Hip::BasicConcepts::CupPlacement"
"The normal hip joint is best understood as a Lever-Arm.

Femoral Anteversion is about 15 degrees, but the {{c1::native anatomy}} of the femur often dictates the version for a press-fit stem (for a cemented stem, or an S-ROM stem, the surgeon has much more control over the femoral version).  Many surgeons use the {{c1::posterior cortex}} of the femur, at the femoral neck cut, as their guide for setting version.											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Hip::BasicConcepts::StemPlacement"

A good landmark for tibial rotation in TKA is to align the anterior aspect of the tibial component with the {{c1::medial 1/3 of the patellar tendon}}.	If the tibial component is internally rotated, the tibia bone is now relatively externally rotated compared to the femur, which will rotate the tibial tubercle laterally, and thus increase the Q angle and increase risk for dislocation.

Cutting the Distal Femur in TKA affects 3 things:   1) {{c1::Mechanical Alignment}} 2) {{c1::Extension gap}} 3) {{c1::Joint Line Height}}											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
The goal is to place the TKA in {{c1::neutral}} mechanical alignment	Adjusting with the jig for 6 degrees valgus and for 3 degrees of internal rotation posterior condyles										"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
"The knee is typically in neutral mechanical alignment when the ""knee angle"" (tibio-femoral angle) is {{c1::6}}° {{c1::valgus::Varus/Valgus?}}."											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
The difference between the anatomic axis of the femur and the mechanical axis is about {{c1::6}}°, and that is commonly what the intramedullary guide is set to.	The exact measurements should be calculated preoperatively as part of the templating.										"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
The hole for the intramedullary femoral guide in TKA should be drilled just above the {{c1::PCL}} and aimed down the {{c1::medullary canal}}											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
If the TKA extension gap is trapezoidal, this indicates {{c1::soft tissue imbalance}} that requires adjustment.	Should form nice rectangle										"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
The DEPTH of the distal femur for the femoral implant of every company (and therefore the target depth for ALL distal femoral cuts) is {{c1::9}} mm											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
What are the situations where surgeons may increase the depth of the femoral component from 9 mm in TKA?  {{c1::Significant flexion contracture - Resecting more distal femur will enlarge the extension gap (without affecting the flexion gap)}} {{c2::Want to raise the joint line}}											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"

In TKA, the Anterior Femoral Cut is thru the {{c1::trochlear groove}} and the depth of this cut affects the {{c1::patellofemoral}} joint											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
In TKA, the Posterior Femoral Cut is thru the {{c1::posterior condyle}} and the depth of this cut affects the {{c1::flexion gap}}.											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
In TKA, Anterior and Posterior Femoral Cuts are parallel and together they determine the {{c1::rotation}} of the femoral implant.											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
In TKA, the Femoral Implant Size must be determined with a sizing guide, and is based off the {{c1::A-P Diameter::Measurement}}											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
In the native knee, the posterior femoral condyles are not equal size and therefore a line across them is in {{c1::3}}° of {{c1::valgus::Varus or Valgus?}}.	(to match the native tibial plateau angle of 3° varus)										"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
Internal rotation of either the femoral or tibial component of 1-4° in TKA causes {{c1::some lateral patellar tilt/tracking}}											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
Internal rotation of either the femoral or tibial component of 5-8° in TKA causes {{c1::patellar subluxation and pain}}											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
Internal rotation of either the femoral or tibial component of >8° in TKA causes {{c1::dislocation and failure}}											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
Not only does the Flexion Gap need to be rectangular (indication of rotation), but it also needs to be the same size as the {{c1::Extension Gap (9 mm)}}.	Therefore, we are trying to take about 9 mm of bone off the posterior femoral condyles.										"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
What does Posterior Referencing mean?  {{c1::The 4-in-1 femoral cutting jig is rigid in its position from the posterior femoral condyles.}}	This distance is strictly 9 mm, so you will cut 9 mm off the posterior femoral condyles regardless of the jig size that you use.  A smaller jig will take more bone off the anterior cortex cut, and 9 mm off the posterior cortex cut. A bigger jig will take less bone off the anterior cortex cut, and 9 mm off the posterior cortex cut.  So the feet of the jig are set up against the posterior femoral condyles, and you mark this spot with two pins,  then put the 4-in-1 cutting guide (for the determined implant size) onto these two pins and start cutting.										"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
The benefit of Posterior Referencing is that you recreate the normal {{c1::Posterior Condyle Offset}}											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
In TKA, the posterior condylar offset is important because its directly related to the arc of motion before {{c1::impingement}} occurs											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
In TKA Posterior Referencing, if the femoral component is measured “too big” then the anterior cut will be {{c1::too shallow}}, causing the {{c1::patellofemoral}} joint to become {{c2::too tight in flexion (knee stiffness in flexion)}}	Not enough bone is taken and so it's replaced with a lot of metal, which will “overstuff” the patellofemoral joint.										"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
"In TKA Posterior Referencing, if the femoral component is measured ""too small"", the anterior cut will be too {{c2::deep}}, and will cause {{c2::“notching”}}, which may increase risk for {{c1::periprosthetic fracture}}."											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
In TKA Anterior Referencing, if the femur is big relative to the size of the 4-in-1 guide, you will end up removing too much bone posteriorly, which will decrease the {{c1::Posterior Condyle Offset}} and may reduce {{c1::range of motion}}											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
In TKA Anterior Referencing, if the femur is small relative to the size of the 4-in-1 guide, you will end up removing too {{c2::little}} bone posteriorly, and the {{c1::Flexion Gap}} will be small relative to the {{c1::Extension gap}}.											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
Across most device companies, the standard thickness of the Patellar Button is {{c1::9}} mm. Therefore, the standard patellar cut should be {{c1::9::(Same)}} mm.	Measure the depth of the native patella, subtract 9 mm, and then set the patellar cutting guide to that number (if the average patellar depth is 20 mm, the patellar cutting guide is set to 11-12 mm, although many surgeons set it to 14 mm to avoid cutting the patella too thin).										"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
It's important to avoid cutting the patella too thin because there is an increased risk of fracture and higher rate of AVN when the patella is cut to < {{c2::12 mm}} of native patella.	The standard prosthetic design has 3-pegs because there is a lower risk of fracture compared to the single peg design.										"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Bone_Cuts"
If the medial or lateral compartment is looser in TKA, this side will experience less {{c1::tension}} and may lead to {{c2::an unstable TKA}} and/or {{c2::asymmetric wear and early failure}}.	Gap balance measured with a spacer block										"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::GapBalance"

Ranawat Valgus Class III  Knee Angle (Femoral-Tibial Angle): {{c1::>20}}o MCL Status: {{c1::Absent or Severely Attenuated}}											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::GapBalance"
If the MCL is intact, then a {{c1::primary}} TKA poly insert can be used.   If the MCL is elongated, a {{c1::constrained}} poly may be necessary to give sufficient coronal stability.											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::GapBalance"
There is a risk of recurrent {{c1::Valgus}} deformity after primary TKA when the MCL is deficient and a(n) {{c2::primary}} insert is used	(even when satisfactory ligament balancing occurs at the time of surgery)										"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::GapBalance"
In TKA, if the MCL is completely absent, a {{c1::hinge prosthesis}} should be considered as excessive stress to a constrained insert may cause {{c2::significant wear, early loosening, and post fracture::3 things}}.	(even when satisfactory ligament balancing occurs at the time of surgery)  Although hinge prostheses also have a higher rate of aseptic loosening secondary to increased constraint										"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::GapBalance"
When performing lateral releases in TKA, the {{c1::peroneal nerve}} is at risk between the {{c2::IT band}} and {{c2::Popliteus}} at the level of the tibial cut.											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::GapBalance"
In the case of a hypoplastic LFC in TKA (seen with Valgus knees), the posterior referencing system may need to dial in {{c1::5}}° or more to prevent {{c1::internal rotation}} of the femoral component.											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::GapBalance"
In TKA, if there is > {{c1::5}} mm of deficient bone on the posterior or distal femoral cut, augments should be considered because a cement mantle this large will lead to {{c1::early loosening}}.											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::GapBalance"
The patella engages the trochlear groove in 20° flexion, as the knee continues to flex the entire patella engages and the patella translates {{c1::laterally}} and tilts {{c1::medially}}.											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Patella_Tracking"
Patella is at greatest risk of dislocating in {{c1::30° flexion (as it begins to engage)::Degrees flexion/extension}}, and with further flexion, {{c2::bony constraint (anterior flange of LFC)}} prevents lateral instability											"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Patella_Tracking"
Normally, the patella engages the trochlear groove at 15° flexion, enters the intercondylar notch at X°, but in the case of Patella Baja (elevated joint line) the patella enters the intercondylar notch earlier in {{c1::flexion}} and impinges on the {{c1::polyethylene insert}} causing pain, osteolysis, and limits flexion.

What makes up the Posteromedial Corner of the Knee?  {{c1::Posterior Oblique Ligament SemiMembranosus Posterior Horn of the Medial Meniscus}}	Provide 30% of valgus restraint in full extension and with greater flexion the MCL assumes more responsibility - 60% in 5° flexion and 80% in 25° flexion.										"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Native_Kinematics"
Since the Native Tibia joint line is in Slight Varus (~3o), we resect more from the {{c1::LATERAL}} side during the Tibial Cuts in TKA								Theoretically over resecting lateral tibial bone causes some varus laxity.  You can compensate by performing a medial release of soft tissue (such as taking down some of the deep MCL); or adjust the bony cuts on the femoral side by: a) under-resect the lateral distal femur (decrease the valgus angle slightly to 6° based on the intramedullary femur guide... instead of cutting the femur at 9°) to reconcile the extension gap b) balance the flexion gap by adding 3° of external rotation (this technique was originally implemented to compensate for the tibial cut…and the improved patellar tracking is just an added bonus)			"#Ortho::HipKneeBook::Knee::BasicConcepts::Native_Kinematics"
