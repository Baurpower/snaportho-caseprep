{"question": "While initial studies suggested increased risk of THA dislocation with the posterior approach, what two surgical techniques significantly reduce dislocation risk?", "answer": "a meticulous soft-tissue repair  larger femoral head", "additional_info": "This helps make rates similar to other approaches (anterolateral and direct anterior). However, hip precautions are recommended for posterior approach regardless of the quality of soft tissue repair. Precautions are not required for Direct Anterior approach.   Because hip instability is related to both patient factors (ie compliance) and surgical factors, patients are faced with additional risk factors for dislocation with the posterior approach (as compared with DA)", "metadata": {"specialty": "Recon", "region": "Hip", "procedure": "", "diagnosis": ""}}

{"question": "What does Posterior Referencing mean?", "answer": "The 4-in-1 femoral cutting jig is rigid in its position from the posterior femoral condyles.", "additional_info": "This distance is strictly 9 mm, so you will cut 9 mm off the posterior femoral condyles regardless of the jig size that you use.  A smaller jig will take more bone off the anterior cortex cut, and 9 mm off the posterior cortex cut. A bigger jig will take less bone off the anterior cortex cut, and 9 mm off the posterior cortex cut.  So the feet of the jig are set up against the posterior femoral condyles, and you mark this spot with two pins,  then put the 4-in-1 cutting guide (for the determined implant size) onto these two pins and start cutting.", "metadata": {"specialty": "Recon", "region": "Knee", "procedure": "", "diagnosis": ""}}
