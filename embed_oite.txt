{{c1::Pericytes (Mesenchymal Cells)}} are stem cells that give rise to the majority of new tissue required to bridge a fracture.	At rest, pericytes form part of the boundary of blood vessels in bone. When a vessel is damaged as a result of fracture, pericytes are activated and begin to proliferate. Once activated, pericytes differentiate into osteoblasts or chondrocytes depending on the local microenvironment. The most significant source of pericytes for fracture healing is the vasculature of the periosteum and endosteum.										"#Ortho::Misc_Books::SkeletalTrauma::4_FractureHealing"

Cortical screws are designed to be used in bone with dense trabecular architecture, so they maximize {{c1::Core Diameter}} at the expense of limiting the {{c1::Inner:Outer diameter Ratio }}											"#Ortho::Misc_Books::SkeletalTrauma::9_InternalFixation"
Cancellous screws are designed to be used in bone with loose trabecular architecture, requiring design to sacrifice {{c1::bending resistance (Core Diameter)}} in order to maximize the {{c1::pullout strength resistance}}	Bending strength of a screw is proportional to Inner (Core) diameter^3  Screw pullout strength is proportional to Outer (major) diameter^2 - Maximized by Large outer diameter difference & Fine Pitch  In cancellous bone, the area that confers the greatest resistance to pullout is the intramedullary portion (because cortical bone is extremely thin at the metaphyseal and epiphyseal level).  The intramedullary portion consists of loosely packed trabeculae that may or may not contact the screw threads at the outer diameter.  Because of this, the design of the screw represents an attempt to capture contact with as many trabeculae as possible, understanding that they may not be at the periphery or outer diameter of the screw.  In this sense, a sacrifice is made by marginalizing the inner diameter of the screw to have more trabecular contact area with the thread.
