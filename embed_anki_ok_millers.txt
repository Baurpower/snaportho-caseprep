The {{c1::inferior glenohumeral ligament}} is the most important {{c2::static stabilizer}} of the shoulder.	Superior and middle glenohumeral ligaments are secondary stabilizers.	4																"#OrthoKing::#Millers::Chapter_1_Basic_Sciences::Section_4_Other_Basic_Principles::Biomaterials_and_Biomechanics"
