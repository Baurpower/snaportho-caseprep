"The Anterior Iliofemoral approach to the hip is also known as the ""{{c1::Smith-Peterson}}"" approach"											"#Ortho::Netters::Thigh_Hip::Misc"
ANTERIOR APPROACH TO HIP  The {{c1::Lateral Femoral Cutaneous}} nerve reaches the thigh by passing over, behind, or through (usually over) the {{c1::Sartorius}} muscle, about 2.5 cm below the ASIS.						VuMedi: Direct Anterior (Modified Hueter) Approach to the Hip					"#Ortho::Netters::Thigh_Hip::Misc"
ANTERIOR APPROACH TO HIP  The sartorius is retracted {{c1::upward}} and {{c1::medially}} and the tensor fasciae latae is retracted {{c1::downward}} and {{c1::laterally}}.											"#Ortho::Netters::Thigh_Hip::Misc"
ANTERIOR APPROACH TO HIP  The {{c1::Ascending}} branch of the {{c1::Lateral Femoral Circumflex}} artery crosses the gap between the sartorius and TFL below the ASIS and must be ligated or coagulated.

ANTERIOR APPROACH TO HIP   If you are having difficulty ID'ing the plane b/w the rectus femoris and gluteus medius, palpate the {{c1::femoral}} artery.
